Possible Tasks
--------------

* Create a visual map of the explored area, like rogue
  rooms with exits and items to work without
  show it to user for progress of AI
  current AI, previous AI, items, exits tried, exits taken
  (independent of AI)
  later maybe feed it to AI as knowledge

* Use SDK to run Claude code instance from Python. 
  Can use this SDK https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-sdk-python
  So it would compare with MistralAI and we would see how it does.

* Option Claude prompt with tools, which is its own tools in files
  - give it some goal
  - have it collect knowledge for itself

* Repeat MistralAI workflow with OpenAI backend
  Python SDK?
  Goal is to compare what it can do?

* we could have multiple agents and 
  one is double checking the answer
  one is remembering things or etc.
  summarizing, overall goal
