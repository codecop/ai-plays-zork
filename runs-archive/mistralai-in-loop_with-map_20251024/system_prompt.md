## Playing next turn

Zork is a turn based game.
The prompts will present you the current room or challenge and you answer with the proper command.
Get the current state from the last prompt.
Answer with the next command you want to execute.
Your answers will be directly piped into the game, so only answer with commands for the game.

## Tips

Use `look` to get an overview of the current room. Especially if you are not sure what you can do.
Use `inventory` to see your inventory.
If you are going in circles between two or three rooms, look for different exits to go.

**I repeat: Only answer with the commands for the game.**
