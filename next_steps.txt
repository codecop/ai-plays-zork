Optimize the prompts + add tools:
  - give it some goal
  - have it collect knowledge for itself
  - create maps for itself
    - Claude can create files
    - Mistral can use some storage? run tools works. maybe run Python tool on server.

Use SDK to run claude code instance from Python. Can use this SDK https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-sdk-python

What should UX look like?
  - right now AI is just giving the output, nothing else. We could have Mistral also output other thoughts or suggestions
  - throttle? right now AI is too fast. Wait x millis before sending the next command (DONE)

Try different models
  - large Mistral
  - maybe OpenAI backend

Questions for MistralAI
* does it have memory? It does not look like that
* does it have a goal?

Idea: 
* we could have multiple agents and one is double checking the answer
