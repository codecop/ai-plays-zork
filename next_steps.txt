Cleanup Tasks (alone)

* make tmux work on Windows
* make OpenAI AI implementation like Mistral and let it run
* make mcp server running Frotz inside

Possible Tasks
==============

Command Line Tools for Claude or other CLI Agents
* What do we need from the map? What's the query?
* Track items that we find
* Breadcrumbs: paths and what happened
* Track open tasks

Visualization
-------------

* show the map as Graphviz, this is WIP
  TODO next fix layout of the map using port and rank so it is correct aligned

* Create a visual map of the explored area, like rogue
  rooms with exits and items to work without
  show it to user for progress of AI
  current AI, previous AI, items, exits tried, exits taken
  (independent of AI)
  later maybe feed it to AI as knowledge

---

Other models
-------------

First step is to write a test for a conversation/completion.
  - having a state and asking several questions on that
  - using a System prompt as guidance

* Use a local model from OpenAI "oss20b..." 
  through Ollama

* Use SDK to run Claude code instance from Python. 
  Can use this SDK https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-sdk-python
  So it would compare with MistralAI and we would see how it does.

* Option Claude prompt with tools, which is its own tools in files
  - give it some goal
  - have it collect knowledge for itself

* Repeat MistralAI workflow with OpenAI backend
  Python SDK?
  Goal is to compare what it can do?

---

* we could have multiple agents and 
  one is double checking the answer
  one is remembering things or etc.
  summarizing, overall goal
