# Claude Code MCP Server Setup

## Quick Start

To add this MCP server to Claude Code, run:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport stdio local-add python <path-to-repo>/src/mcp/local-add-mcp-server.py
```

Replace `<path-to-repo>` with the absolute path to your repository.

## Verify Installation

Check that the server is connected:

```bash
claude mcp list
```

You should see:

```
local-add: python <path-to-repo>/src/mcp/local-add-mcp-server.py - âœ“ Connected
```

## Inside Claude Code

Once configured, you can verify the MCP server is available by running the `/mcp` command within Claude Code.

## Removing the Server

If you need to remove the server:

```bash
claude mcp remove local-add
```

## Troubleshooting

* MCP servers are configured per-project by default (local scope)
* The configuration is stored in `~/.claude.json`
* No restart of Claude Code is needed after adding stdio servers
* Make sure Python is available in your PATH
