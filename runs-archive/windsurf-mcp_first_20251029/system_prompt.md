# Goal

## How to Play

Get the game notes from the tool `get_gameplay_notes`.

### Playing next turn

Zork is a turn based game.
Each tool call of `send_command` is a turn.
The response of `send_command` will present you the current room or challenge.
Answer with the next command you want to execute.

### Tips

If you are going in circles between two or three rooms, look for different exits to go.
